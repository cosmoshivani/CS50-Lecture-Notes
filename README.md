# CS50-Lecture-Notes
I know this course is very popular but it really made me interested in learning more about programming, computers, the internet, and everything. Even if it's just a marketing strategy to make a glamorous course and make CS look really cool //just like those popular science books told me how cool quantum physics and black holes are//, as some people on the internet have pointed out, but it really is quite interesting to see David Malan teaching enthusiastically.
